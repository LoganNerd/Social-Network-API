# Social-Network-API
Creating a social network API!

## Summary:
In this project I was tasked with creating a social network API that has users, friends, thoughts and reactions. I created models for what each portion would look like, routed them together, and created controllers. The final product is manageable in Insomnia.

date.js came from my tutor, and the basic framework layout came from the mini project. Everything else was added in or changed by myself with help from my tutor.
